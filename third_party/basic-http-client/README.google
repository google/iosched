Description:

A minimal HTTP client that uses java.net.HttpURLConnection to make requests. It
features a simple interface for making Web requests. There is also an
AsyncHttpClient which supports making asynchronous requests with retries and
exponential backoff, and AndroidHttpClient which wraps requests in an Android
AsyncTask so that requests can be safely initiated from the UI thread.

Local Modifications:
Removed unsed jar file lib/servlet-api-2.5.jar
