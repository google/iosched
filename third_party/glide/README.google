Description:

Glide is fast and efficient image loading library for Android that wraps image
downloading, resizing, memory and disk caching, and bitmap recycling into one
simple and easy to use interface. By default, Glide includes an implementation
for fetching images over http based on Google's Volley project for fast,
parallelized network operations on Android.

Local Modifications:
Removed samples and tests. Moved third party gif decoder into top level
third_party directory.
