It was designed to avoid memory leaks and null pointer exceptions between an activity or fragment and a ViewModel. \n\nHowever, you can also use LiveData beyond the ViewModel. Components like Room or Workmanager also expose LiveData observables, and you can make your own data sources lifecycle-aware.\n\nIn this talk, we'll deep dive into patterns with LiveData such as the different types of transformations (map, switchMap and MediatorLiveData), handling events and building reactive architectures as well as common antipatterns and code-smells to avoid.",
