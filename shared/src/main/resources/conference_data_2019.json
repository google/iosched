The other is to predict trends affecting business, medicine, finance, and our way of life, based on the latest research in science. He has written four New York Times Bestsellers: The Future of Humanity, The Future of The Mind, Physics of The Future, and Physics of The Impossible. All achieved top spots on the New York Times, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble bestsellers Lists, and #1 hardcover, non-fiction book in the country for The Future of The Mind. Kaku has over 3 million fans on Facebook and well over half a million people follow his tweets on Twitter.\r\nDr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair in Theoretical Physics at the City Univ. of New York. He graduated from Harvard University in 1968 (summa cum laude and 1st in his physics class). He received his Ph.D. in physics from UC Berkeley in 1972, and has been a professor at CUNY for almost 30 years; he has taught at Harvard and Princeton as well. His goal is to complete Einstein’s dream of a “theory of everything,” to derive an equation, perhaps no more than one inch long, which will summarize all the physical laws of the universe. He is the co-founder of string field theory, a major branch of string theory, which is the leading candidate today for the theory of everything.

He joined Disney in 1974, where he trained under three of Walt Disney’s “Nine Old Men”, Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas and Eric Larson. Keane began his career animating scenes on The Rescuers before being promoted to directing animator on The Fox and the Hound.
