Google I/O Android App
======================

Google I/O is a developer conference held each year with two days of deep
technical content featuring technical sessions and hundreds of demonstrations
from developers showcasing their technologies.

This project is the Android app for the conference. The app supports devices
running Android 4.0+, and is optimized for phones and tablets of all shapes
and sizes. It also contains an Android Wear integration.
