# How to build IOSched

Note: while these instructions allow you to build iosched, much of the
functionality that depends on server APIs won't work because in order to
do that you need to configure your own project in Google Developer
Console, create API keys, etc. For more information about what you
need to set up, refer to [Server side setup](#server-side-setup).

This is a Gradle-based project that works best with
[Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)

> __NOTE__: Building the project as-is requires the Android Wear SDK, which you
    can download from http://developer.android.com/wear/. If you wish to build
    without Android Wear support, please refer to the [Building without Android
    Wear](#building-without-android-wear) section.

To build the app:

1. Install the following software:
       - Android SDK:
         http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
       - Gradle:
         http://www.gradle.org/downloads
       - Android Studio:
         http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html

2. Run the Android SDK Manager by pressing the SDK Manager toolbar button
   in Android Studio or by running the 'android' command in a terminal
   window.


3. In the Android SDK Manager, ensure that the following are installed,
   and are updated to the latest available version:
       - Tools > Android SDK Platform-tools (rev 21 or above)
       - Tools > Android SDK Tools (rev 23.0.5 or above)
       - Tools > Android SDK Build-tools version 20
       - Tools > Android SDK Build-tools version 21 (rev 21.0.2 or above)
       - Android 4.4W > SDK Platform (API 20)
       - Android 5.0 > SDK Platform (API 21)
       - Extras > Android Support Repository
       - Extras > Android Support Library
       - Extras > Google Play services
       - Extras > Google Repository

4. Create a file in your working directory called local.properties,
   containing the path to your Android SDK. Use local.properties.example as a
   model.

5. Import the project in Android Studio:

    1. Press File > Import Project
    2. Navigate to and choose the settings.gradle file in this project
    3. Press OK

6. Add your debug keystore to the project (save it as android/debug.keystore), 
    or modify the build.gradle file to point to your key.

7. Choose Build > Make Project in Android Studio or run the following
    command in the project root directory:
   ```
    ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
   ```
8. To install on your test device:

   ```
    ./gradlew installDebug
   ```


## Building without Android Wear

If you do not wish to build the Android Wear component, you can remove or
comment out the following line on android/build.gradle:

      wearApp project(":Wearable")

Also, remove ':Wearable' from settings.gradle, leaving only ':android'.


# Server-side setup

These steps are optional, in the sense that IOSched will build and run
even if you don't set up the server side. However, unless you perform
this setup, your build won't be able to use any of the Google APIs
such as Google sign in, Google Drive integration, Google Maps integration,
etc. So following the instructions in this section is highly
recommended.

0. Change the project's package name to your own package name.
To do that, you can set the "package" attribute of the <manifest>
tag in AndroidManifest.xml.

1. Create a project in the Google Developers Console,
at https://cloud.google.com/console

2. Note your project's Project ID. It is a 11-12 digit sequence
that appears in the URL, indicated by ########### below:
    ```
    https://console.developers.google.com/project/###########/...
    ```
    Write down this project ID number you will need it soon.

3. In the APIs and Auth section, enable these APIs:
    - Drive API
    - Google Cloud Messaging for Android
    - Google Maps Android API v2
    - Google+ API
    - YouTube Data API v3

4. In the Credentials section, create a Client ID for Android applications
with your package name and your certificate fingerprint. As a reminder,
you can get your debug certificate fingerprint by issuing this command:
    ```
    keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey \
        -keystore $HOME/.android/debug.keystore -list -v
    ```
    It's also advisable to create a Client ID corresponding to your release
    certificate as well. To get your release certificate's fingerprint, run:
    ```
    keytool -exportcert -alias your-key-name \
        -keystore /path/to/your/release/keystore/file -list -v
    ```

5. Still in the Credentials section, create an API Key for Public API
access. The key's type is Key for Android applications, and you should
add both your debug and release certificate fingerprints in the
list of accepted certificates. Note the API key you created. It's
a long alphanumeric string with digits, letters and with a 
few underscores.

6. Enter your API Key from Step 5 into this file:
    ```
    android/src/main/res/values/maps_api_key.xml
    ```
7. Enter your API key in the YOUTUBE_API_KEY constant in Config.java

Done. IOSched should now work with Google sign in, Google Drive
integration and Maps integration. Note that we did NOT include
setting up GCM. For more information about this, see [CUSTOM.md](CUSTOM.md).
