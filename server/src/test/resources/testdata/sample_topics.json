Our work has resulted in the development of a set of user experience principles for mobile website design. The principles illustrate how to create experiences that support conversion on mobile, whether that be for a purchase, a quote or a lead. The principles have been developed out of a study that Google User Experience Research conducted in partnership with AnswerLab - a user research consultancy. We studied 100 sites with diversity across size and vertical, and held 119 in-person, one-hour usability sessions with Android and iOS smartphone users. We instructed participants to perform key conversion-focused tasks, such as purchasing an item, booking a reservation, or researching plans or prices.  This presentation will illustrate key principles for designing a better mobile web. ",

They must give users all the benefits of technology they've come to expect, and more, while meeting them on their terms in a seamless and intrinsically human way.\n\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the constellation of devices that make up not just wearable, but ubiquitous computing.  We'll tie them all together with a common set of design guidelines, development practices, and the Google Platform.

What started as hobbies and hackathon projects have evolved into sustainable businesses that serve millions of users around the globe. These tools rely on open data about our societies, governments and physical world, but transform it and make it useful.\n\nWe\u2019re going to provide concrete examples of the motivations, technologies and challenges of how Google and our partner developers are making people safer and reinvigorating our democracies, and share what we\u2019ve learned about how anyone can get started using their skills to make a difference. \n\n(Link: go/airbender-cross-device)",

Deriving meaning from your data, at any scale, doesn't have to involve a tangle of clusters, configurations, and scripts that takes a team of specialized administrators to unravel. In fact, you can make it manageable and easy for all developers without losing insight in the process. We've created easy-to-use services so that you can run deep analytics on both streaming and historical data with as little effort as hosting an app on App Engine. \n\nHowever, sometimes, you need more control and configurability than managed services allow. That doesn't mean that you lose all the benefits of the Big Data tools that Google Cloud Platform has developed. You can easily combine managed services, where it makes sense, with Open Source tools like Hadoop and Spark. This session will dive into what you can use today to manage Big Data like Google itself does, \u201cthe Cloud way\u201d, as well as how you can plan to scale as your data needs shift and mature.",

            "Description": "Neptune Beach's two huge outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian Johnny Weismuller, who later starred as the original Tarzan, and Jack LaLanne, who started a chain of health clubs. The park closed down in 1939 because of the Great Depression, the completion of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge, people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.",

            "Description": "Some of the resort homes and buildings from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The Croll Building, on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for the some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautiful preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort life was like in Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.\n\nThe vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures \u2013 the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the Ferris wheel, the roller coaster, and other rides \u2013 were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost. Today,[when?] A consequence of the Neptune Beach closing around 1940 was a total dearth of quality, clean swimming facilities in town. A grass roots effort to create swimming pools at two high schools and two city parks would continue into the early 1960s.",

            "Description": "The need for expanded shipping facilities led to the dredging of a canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda in 1902, turning Alameda into an island. Most of the soil from the canal was used to fill in nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author Jack London was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone. The Alameda Works Shipyard was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the Alameda Estuary, where the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane was used. Today,[when?] the Port of Oakland across the estuary serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast, using the shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda. As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a \"Coast Guard City,\" one of seven in the country.",

Brilliant as great developers are, there are plenty of things that they hate doing or are just no good at. Coding requires a level of focus bordering on tunnel vision, and if there\u2019s one thing developers hate, it\u2019s distractions. For a coder \u201cdistractions\u201d mean dealing with business people, management, customers or, in fact, anyone outside the engineering team. If you want to get popular with developers, spare them from some of these interactions, which they often see as a shocking waste of their time. A great product manager, for example, is as crucial to success as a competent coder. It doesn\u2019t matter how clear the code is, if nobody wants the product. Translate the language of the developers into that of the users and vice versa. Promote the product. All makers of creative work want their work to be used. Marsh concludes that it\u2019s much more important to understand coders than to understand code.\n",

It is located on Alameda Island and Bay Farm Island, and is adjacent to and west of Oakland and in eastern San Francisco Bay across from San Francisco and South San Francisco, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Bay Farm Island, a portion of which is also known as \"Harbor Bay Isle\", is not actually an island, and is part of the mainland adjacent to the Oakland International Airport. In 2014 the city had a total population of 75,467. Alameda is a charter city, rather than a general law city, allowing the city to provide for any form of government. Alameda became a charter city and adopted a council-manager government in 1916, which it retains to the present.",

The area of the former NAS is now known as Alameda Point. In late July 2006, the City of Alameda announced a deal with the Navy that would turn the land over to the city for $108M. The transfer process was initially slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the city regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land.\n\nIn September 2010 the US Veterans Administration proposed construction of a $209 million state-of-the-art facility at Alameda Point that would provide primary care, specialty care, and mental health, substance abuse and other services. [1] The VA received Congressional $17.33 million in budget authority for the project in 2011. But concerns over the proximity to a nesting site for an endangered bird, the California Least Tern, have led to delays in moving the project forward. The VA\u2019s 2012 and 2013 budget requests to Congress contain no funding requests for Alameda Point. [2]\n\nIn September 2011 Alameda and the Navy reached an agreement on the terms of a no-cost conveyance for the entire 918 acres at Alameda Point.",

Following the Encinal, several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the Daily Argus eventually rose to prominence. A young Alameda native, Joseph R. Knowland, wrote political and historical articles for the Alameda papers. Later, Knowland owned the powerful Oakland Tribune. Around 1900, the Daily Argus began to fade in importance and east and west papers The Times and The Star combined to take the leading role as the Alameda Times-Star in the 1930s. The Times-Star was sold to the Alameda Newspaper Group in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1997, the Hills Newspaper chain was bought by Knight Ridder, at the time, the second-largest newspaper chain in the U.S. Following the buyout, former Hills Newspapers employees recognized the lack of a local community voice in Alameda, and again formed a new locally-based newspaper, the Alameda Sun, in 2001.",
