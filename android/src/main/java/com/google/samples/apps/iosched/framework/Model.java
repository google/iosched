 * obtains the data from the {@link com.google.samples.apps.iosched.provider.ScheduleProvider} by
 * creating a {@link android.content.CursorLoader} and then parsing the received
 * {@link android.database.Cursor}.

 * Additionally, when a {@link UserActionEnum} is received, the model updates both its own data and
 * the stored data by making an update or insert call on the
 * {@link com.google.samples.apps.iosched.provider.ScheduleProvider}.
