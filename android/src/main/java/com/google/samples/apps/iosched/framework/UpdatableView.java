/**
 * An UpdatableView is a UI class, often a {@link android.app.Fragment}, that provides a
 * {@link Presenter} an interface through which to control it  (MVP architectural pattern).
 * It is parametrised by the {@link Model} class.
 * <p />
 * The {@link Presenter} registers itself as a {@link UserActionListener} with
 * {@link #addListener(UserActionListener)}, so that it can trigger an update on the {@link Model}
 * when the user performs an action on the UpdatableView. After the data is updated, the
 * {@link Presenter} updates the UpdatableView by calling {@link #displayData(Object, QueryEnum)}
 * or {@link #displayErrorMessage(QueryEnum)} so the UpdatableView can redraw itself with the
 * updated data.
 * <p />
 * The UpdatableView belongs to an {@link android.app.Activity} that typically has been started
 * with an {@link android.content.Intent} specifying at least one Data URI, used for loading the
 * initial data into the {@link Model}.
