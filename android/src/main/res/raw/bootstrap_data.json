Finally, some developers want complete control over every aspect of the presentation.  \n\nThis session will highlight the Maps APIs representing the full gamut of the developer experiences, enabling you to get going immediately and scale as necessary. You'll see how widgets and services can be added over time with a suite of Maps APIs, services and libraries.",

            "description": "In the last decade, user demand for always-on applications have grown, exponentially. Many developers choose application patterns to meet this need, but what about the infrastructure needed to support these ever growing demands? In this talk, we will introduce you to the next level of automation using hands-on examples of industry standard tooling like Docker, a container format, and Kubernetes, a distributed automation platform. We'll cover the basics of modern day applications and how design patterns like microservices drive the need for more robust infrastructure. Then we'll cover packaging and distributing apps using Docker. Finally, we'll up our game to running applications on Kubernetes. By the end of this talk you'll have the knowledge needed to excel at scale.",

This session explains how you can use the ExoPlayer streaming media library to help provide your users with a great media experience. The talk provides an overview of the ExoPlayer's design, and highlights the advantages of ExoPlayer over other libraries such as MediaPlayer.\n\nThe ExoPlayer provides many sophisticated features such as Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH), SmoothStreaming and Common Encryption. It's designed to be easy to customize and extend, and many components can be replaced with custom implementations. Because ExoPlayer is a library that you include in your application, it can be easily updated along with your app.\n\nAfter attending this talk you'll understand how to integrate ExoPlayer into your application. If you are using it to replace MediaPlayer, this can be a quick and simple integration. However, you'll also come away with an understanding of the design and inner workings of ExoPlayer, including how to wire up ExoPlayer instances using custom components to satisfy the most demanding performance and UX requirements, as well as take full advantage of the sophisticated features provided by the player.",

            "description": "Motion plays a key role in bringing material design to life. Material uses motion to educate the user about hierarchy, guide focus through the experience, and even add delight in sometimes unexpected places. The material design team has revamped the Motion guidelines to include detailed guidance on all things motion, from basic duration and easing curves suggestions to natural surface transformations and intricate choreography of moving elements. Join John Schlemmer, Material Motion Lead, as he gives the scoop on this new design guidance and shares his approach to motion on apps like Google Calendar and Inbox by Gmail.",

Now, it's critical to design our applications to adapt to the device display, and even to the user's context. But what about users with both Android and iOS devices? Or users switching from one platform to another? With material design, Mike Denny shows how it's possible to design once and build everywhereâ€”all while respecting platform conventions and user expectations.",

In 2006, Google developed Linux container technology that enabled world leading fleet utilization, efficiency and scale.  More recently, these same core technologies formed the foundation of Docker, the popular, new open source container environment.  \n\nJoin us in this session and see how containers are re-making the cloud computing landscape. Learn how Google Cloud Platform is making itself the best place in the world to run container images.  Come see how containers and Google Cloud Platform make it easier to build, run and maintain distributed systems, by building on the same core container technologies that power all of Google.  Get a first look at Kubernetes, the new open source container cluster management implementation that turns these concepts into reality. Come learn how containers and Google Cloud Platform make the technology and application architectures that power Google available to all developers across the world. ",

We also recently launched the source code to End-To-End, an encryption extension for Chrome, where we're explicitly calling for community feedback. And then there's the Google Transparency Report, which includes information both from Safe Browsing and from our Safer Email effort to understand how much encrypted email we send and receive. Please join us for a session about how Google's security team approaches its work, updates about End-To-End, Safe Browsing, and Safer Email, and how developers can tap into what we do.",
