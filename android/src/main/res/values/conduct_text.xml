    <!-- Long-form text explaining the code of conduct for attending the conference in person -->
    <string name="welcome_conduct_text"><b>Be excellent to each other.</b>\nWe want I/O to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, differing abilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, age or religion. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions.\n\n<b>Speak up if you see or hear something.</b>\nHarassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.\n\n<b>Practice saying \"Yes and\" to each other.</b>\nBuild on each otherâ€™s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.</string>
