He understands that people, tooling, architecture and process all have key roles to play in achieving this. \n\nTo learn, Andrew tries to share both his experiences and his code as widely as possible. He is Capgemini UK's OSS advocate and recently led the creation of an internal Software Craftsmanship Course to help others adopt XP programming practices. He also set up the Capgemini Engineering Blog. This sharing comes not only from his formal consulting engagements - he also mentors undergraduates, posts blogs, speaks and contributes to open source projects and forums."}],"links":[{"href":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1c04ce7ce6ac1ac03481475f27b78881?d=identicon&s=100","rel":"thumbnail","name":"gravatar","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/events/3baa25d3-9cca-459a-90d7-9fc349209289/sessions/e0a6dd79-6b80-48b0-b7a0-856e5e33eb07/speakers/479ae3f6-9bd0-4f82-b9b5-8c7f5d353b4f/photo","rel":"attach-photo"}]}]}}
