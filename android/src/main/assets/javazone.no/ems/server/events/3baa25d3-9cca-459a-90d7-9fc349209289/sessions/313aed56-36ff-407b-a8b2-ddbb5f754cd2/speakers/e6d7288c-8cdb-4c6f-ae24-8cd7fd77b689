The direct contact with the Java community made me want to become an active member in the community itself. For that reason, I have created the Coimbra JUG, started to contribute to Open Source on Github and launched my own blog.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m working with Tomitribe. I\u2019m very excited to work with all the amazing tribers working hard to make TomEE a compelling Java EE server."}],"links":[{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/binary/c25b9848-9195-4d79-b0ae-5487e0103998","rel":"photo","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/binary/c25b9848-9195-4d79-b0ae-5487e0103998?size=thumb","rel":"thumbnail","name":"100x100","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/events/3baa25d3-9cca-459a-90d7-9fc349209289/sessions/313aed56-36ff-407b-a8b2-ddbb5f754cd2/speakers/e6d7288c-8cdb-4c6f-ae24-8cd7fd77b689/photo","rel":"attach-photo"}]}]}}
