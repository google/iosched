I recently ended my studies in the wonders of programming and problem solving at the University of Oslo, where I fell in love with the Semantic Web and logic. For the past year I've been working with semantic technologies in several in-house and external projects. I've been a part of the \"semantic revolution\" at Acando, by writing blog posts and throwing several talks on the subject.\n\nOther than worshiping Linked Open Data, I enjoy Turing machines, circuit electronics, brewing beer and hunting."}],"links":[{"href":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8393e26d699cf2f138d06281471f33a1?d=identicon&s=100","rel":"thumbnail","name":"gravatar","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/events/3baa25d3-9cca-459a-90d7-9fc349209289/sessions/3ec27e60-7367-4a2a-9f24-11ac8a9eb645/speakers/7c831cb2-683c-475b-895c-675f20bb5c5d/photo","rel":"attach-photo"}]}]}}
