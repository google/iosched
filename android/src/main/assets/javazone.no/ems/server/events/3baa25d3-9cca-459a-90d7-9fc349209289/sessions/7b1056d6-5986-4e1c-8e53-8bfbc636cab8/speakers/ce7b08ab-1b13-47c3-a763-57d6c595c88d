He has a background from Java, Groovy and JavaScript development. A few years ago he started to develop a keen interest for functional programming and in particular Clojure/ClojureScript. Last year he made a decision to learn more about statically typed functional languages and Elm popped up as the most interesting and approachable candidate to get started with. To get a flying start with Elm, Magnus created an Elm plugin for his favourite editor -  Light Table.  During daytime he is still developing in Groovy, Clojure and JavaScript. Evenings and nights are often spent deep diving into functional programming, blogging and developing on his Oper Source projects."}],"links":[{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/binary/e8fa5685-0f0f-4625-a6bc-49b852d2d502","rel":"photo","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/binary/e8fa5685-0f0f-4625-a6bc-49b852d2d502?size=thumb","rel":"thumbnail","name":"100x100","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/events/3baa25d3-9cca-459a-90d7-9fc349209289/sessions/7b1056d6-5986-4e1c-8e53-8bfbc636cab8/speakers/ce7b08ab-1b13-47c3-a763-57d6c595c88d/photo","rel":"attach-photo"}]}]}}
