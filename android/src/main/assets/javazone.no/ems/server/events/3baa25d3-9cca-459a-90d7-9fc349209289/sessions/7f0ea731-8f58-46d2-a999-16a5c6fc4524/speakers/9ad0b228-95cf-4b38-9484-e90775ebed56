He loves functional programming \u2013 especially in languages with strong type systems, but still has a weak spot in his heart for C. When not tinkering with programming or programming language theory he can be found kayaking in the Oslo fjord."}],"links":[{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/binary/54116577-de8a-478d-af9f-c85da029c237","rel":"photo","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/binary/54116577-de8a-478d-af9f-c85da029c237?size=thumb","rel":"thumbnail","name":"100x100","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/events/3baa25d3-9cca-459a-90d7-9fc349209289/sessions/7f0ea731-8f58-46d2-a999-16a5c6fc4524/speakers/9ad0b228-95cf-4b38-9484-e90775ebed56/photo","rel":"attach-photo"}]}]}}
