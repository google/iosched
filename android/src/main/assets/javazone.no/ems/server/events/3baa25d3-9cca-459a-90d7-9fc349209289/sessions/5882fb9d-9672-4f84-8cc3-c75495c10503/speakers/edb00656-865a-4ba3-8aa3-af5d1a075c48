I have worked with database technologies for over 20 years, and I strongly believe in using the right technology for the right purpose. This could be anything from NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra and ElasticSearch, or RDBM Systems such as MS SQL Server, PostgresSQL, MySQL, DB2 or Oracle. The last year I've also started to look into BigData technologies evolving around the Hadoop framework. \n\nI strongly believe that performance is a feature, and that programmers and system owners get the systems they deserve.\n\nIn 2015 I  became an Oracle ACE Associate, for my knowledge and contributions towards the Oracle communities."}],"links":[{"href":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e65ce4fefa07c8f74b480c572e97f0e0?d=identicon&s=100","rel":"thumbnail","name":"gravatar","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/events/3baa25d3-9cca-459a-90d7-9fc349209289/sessions/5882fb9d-9672-4f84-8cc3-c75495c10503/speakers/edb00656-865a-4ba3-8aa3-af5d1a075c48/photo","rel":"attach-photo"}]}]}}
