I constantly read, think, and write about it, and code for a living as well as for fun.\n\nI work as at Disy, Germany's leading provider for spatial and environmental IT-solutions, where I improve the flagship product. I blog about software development on codefx.org and am a long-tail contributor to several open source projects.\n\nI have supported the crowdfunding campaign and followed the project ever since. Back in 2015, I wrote about the prototype (http://blog.codefx.org/libraries/junit-lambda-prototype/),  after its release in February I started playing around (http://blog.disy.net/aarlaubstag-junit5-rust-graphml/) with the alpha version, and I have visited talks about the topic by members of the team. An article for InfoQ is in the making and an interview with the team is planned.\n\nThat being said, I am just a voracious consumer of publicly available information about the project but am not affiliated with the developer team."}],"links":[{"href":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/13eee0ac5d38daea3d6ca6aa6efea5b3?d=identicon&s=100","rel":"thumbnail","name":"gravatar","render":"image"},{"href":"http://javazone.no/ems/server/events/3baa25d3-9cca-459a-90d7-9fc349209289/sessions/5ec54721-31ef-4d67-96ca-43fcdf413e53/speakers/c83d7cda-ac72-43a0-9f8e-f84df47b21e4/photo","rel":"attach-photo"}]}]}}
