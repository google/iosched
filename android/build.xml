    <!-- The local.properties file is created and updated by the 'android' tool.

    <!-- The build.properties file can be created by you and is never touched
         by the 'android' tool. This is the place to change some of the default property values
         used by the Ant rules.
         Here are some properties you may want to change/update:

         application.package
             the name of your application package as defined in the manifest. Used by the
             'uninstall' rule.
         source.dir
             the name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.
         out.dir
             the name of the output directory. Default is 'bin'.

         Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should be updated
          using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

         This file is an integral part of the build system for your application and
         should be checked in in Version Control Systems.

         -->
    <property file="build.properties" />

    <!-- The default.properties file is created and updated by the 'android' tool, as well
         as ADT.
         This file is an integral part of the build system for your application and
         should be checked in in Version Control Systems. -->
    <property file="default.properties" />

         This requires ant 1.6.0 or above. -->

    <!-- Execute the Android Setup task that will setup some properties specific to the target,
         and import the build rules files.

         The rules file is imported from
            <SDK>/platforms/<target_platform>/templates/android_rules.xml

         To customize some build steps for your project:
         - copy the content of the main node <project> from android_rules.xml
         - paste it in this build.xml below the <setup /> task.
         - disable the import by changing the setup task below to <setup import="false" />

         This will ensure that the properties are setup correctly but that your customized
         build steps are used.
    -->
    <setup />
