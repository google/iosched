And with an infinite canvas inside of your application, there are some very real challenges with guiding the user\u2019s focus and attention. We\u2019ll review common interactive patterns for virtual reality applications that work well.

With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This \u201cNo CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA\u201d dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic \u201cNo CAPTCHA\u201d followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site.

While this is great for your general health, and blood pressure, this doesn\u2019t exclude performance problems from happening here.

While this is great for your general health, and blood pressure, this doesn\u2019t exclude performance problems from happening here.

With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This \u201cNo CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA\u201d dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic \u201cNo CAPTCHA\u201d followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site. (Note: This Sandbox talk will be offered twice throughout the event. Check the schedule to confirm timings.)",

Using a package manager to mange this greatly improves your productivity, enhances the speed and security of your application, and makes it much easier to stay up to date. Forget tracking new releases of libraries on blogs/Twitter, manually downloading dependent scripts, and managing the files and folders of libraries you use. With package management, keeping your dependencies updated and discovering new and related projects becomes straight-forward. In this session, we'll dive into the value of client-side package management and bring you up to speed with the open source package manager Bower, which offers a rich ecosystem of packages. Plus, learn about the useful integrations with Yeoman, Grunt, RequireJS, and NPM. ",

As those needs evolve, so too must our designs, practices, and philosophies.\n\nWe challenged ourselves to create a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. The result is material design: a cross-platform design system grounded in tactile reality, inspired by our study of paper and ink, yet open to imagination and magic.\n\nIn this session, design leads across Google discuss the key principles of material design, and set the stage for the later sessions focusing on interaction, motion and visual design.",

We're also empowering anyone to contribute photos and 360-degree panoramas to Google Maps via products like Trekker, Business View, Views, and Photo Sphere. In this talk, we'll show how developers can integrate billions of panoramas into their projects. We'll also show how anyone can quickly publish imagery of places they care about, then easily access them via our APIs and viewers. This session is relevant to developers creating experiences that include location and imagery.",

Did you notice that spike in errors that you were serving at 3am? Because your users sure did. Luckily, we can help. We'll show you how you can use Google Cloud Platform's powerful logging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities to quickly recognize when your applications aren't behaving or performing well. It's easy to set up, and it's easy to use. We'll demonstrate the integration of Stackdriver's monitoring and alerting system with the Google Cloud Platform. When you leave this talk, you'll understand how you can start using our intelligent monitoring, which lets you spend less time on ops and more time developing the next great cloud app!",
